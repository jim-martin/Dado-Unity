To begin modifying your mesh follow this steps :- 
- Add your gameobject to the scene then go to "Menu > Component > Dynamic Mesh System > Dynamic Mesh "
- In the inspector press "Build Arrays" from the Dynamic Mesh Component.
Now you see that your gameobject has many children, each children is a refrence to a vertex, you can now move the children and press "Update Mesh" but this will modify your Asset permanently when done in the Editor so make sure to make a copy first if you want.
To Modify in run-time :-
Create a script , for example :-
/////////////////////////////////////////////
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour {
	public GameObject mygameobject;
	public DynamicMesh mydynamicmesh;
	void Start () {
		mygameobject.transform.position = new Vector3 (10, 10, 10);
		mydynamicmesh.UpdateMesh();
	}
}
/////////////////////////////////////////////
Add this to any gameobject in the scene and drag the vertex gameobject to the script and drag your Dynamic Mesh game object to the script.
so you modify it by modifying the game objects like you normally do.
